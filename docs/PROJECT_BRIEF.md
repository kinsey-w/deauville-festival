# Deauville Festival du Rire - project brief

The Deauville Festival du Rire (10-13 June 2027) needs a platform for its
programme: artists, venues and shows, with the scheduling rules a generic CMS
cannot enforce. The website and the admin are already written. Everything
behind them is yours to build, in Python.

> Replace this README with your own once the project works (see
> [Submission](#submission)).

## What you get

| Path                                     | Content                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [data/festival.json](data/festival.json) | the 2027 edition: 4 venues, 12 artists, 23 performances        |
| [web/public/](web/public/)               | the public website: programme, artists, "now on stage"         |
| [web/admin/](web/admin/)                 | the admin: schedule, move and cancel performances, add artists |
| [API.md](API.md)                         | the HTTP contract the website and the admin rely on            |
| [main.py](main.py)                       | a few lines that read the data file: where you start           |

That is all: no package, no class, no test. The structure of the project is
part of the work. The two HTML folders are static files; they only talk to
your server through the routes of `API.md`.

## What you build

1. **The festival model**: venues, artists, three kinds of performances, and
   the rules below. A rule must hold whoever uses the model: the command line,
   the web API, or a test.
2. **Storage**: load the festival from `data/festival.json`, save it back
   after every change. Loading checks every rule again: a broken file gives a
   clear error, not a traceback.
3. **A command line**, at least:
   - the programme of one festival day, in order;
   - the list of the artists with their number of shows;
   - what is on stage at a given moment, and the next 3 performances.
4. **A web server**, with FastAPI: the routes of [API.md](API.md) under
   `/api`, `web/public/` served at `/` and `web/admin/` at `/admin/`.
5. **Your tests** (pytest), written along the way.

## The rules

### Names and identifiers

- Every name (artist, venue, performance title, participant) is stored without
  the spaces around it, and cannot be empty.
- Artists and venues are identified by a **slug**: lower case ASCII letters,
  digits and single dashes, accents removed.
  `"Théâtre des Planches"` → `"theatre-des-planches"`,
  `"Élodie  Marchal !"` → `"elodie-marchal"`. Two artists with the same slug
  are the same artist; same for venues.
- A performance is identified by its venue slug and its start:
  `"le-kiosque-2027-06-12-0100"`.
- Artists are listed in alphabetical order of their slug (`Élodie` before
  `Hugo`); venues in the order they were added; performances by start time,
  then by venue name.

### Venues, performances and time

- A venue has a name, a number of seats (at least 1) and an address.
- Every performance has a title, a venue, a start (local time, no time zone),
  a duration from 1 to 360 minutes, and a description that may be empty.
- **A festival day ends at 06:00.** A show starting at 00:30 on 12 June is
  part of the 11 June programme.
- A performance must belong to a day of the festival (`first_day` to
  `last_day` of the data file).
- A venue needs **30 minutes** between the end of a performance and the start
  of the next one.
- An artist needs **30 minutes** between two performances, in any venue and
  in any role (solo artist, host, act, teacher).
- Venue, artists and performances referenced by slug or id must exist.

### Three kinds of performances

| Kind       | Who is on stage                     | Specific rules                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `solo`     | one artist                          | a minimum age for the audience, from 0 (everyone) to 18                                                                        |
| `lineup`   | a host, then acts one after another | at least 2 acts, each one only once; the host is not an act; each act needs 10 minutes and the host 3 minutes between two acts |
| `workshop` | a teacher, plus participants        | `max_participants` at least 1; registration by name, until full                                                                |

- A lineup of 3 acts lasts at least `3 × 10 + 2 × 3 = 36` minutes.
- A workshop has `min(max_participants, venue seats)` places. Participant
  names are compared without case: `"Camille R."` is already registered if
  `"camille r."` is.
- The capacity of a solo show or a lineup is the number of seats of its venue.

### Errors

Every broken rule gives a sentence a festival organiser understands:
`"Le Kiosque is busy with After Hours (2027-06-12 01:00-02:00). Leave 30
minutes between two shows."`, not `KeyError: 'le-kiosque'`. The web API
turns these errors into the status codes listed in `API.md` (404, 409, 422,
500).

A change that breaks a rule changes nothing: moving a performance onto a busy
slot leaves it where it was.

## Your decisions

Nobody will tell you which modules or classes to write. Decide, then explain
your choices in your README. A few questions to answer before coding:

- Which objects does the festival have? What does each one know, what does
  each one check?
- What do the three kinds of performances share, and what differs?
- Where does a rule live so that neither the command line nor the API can
  bypass it? Can a caller add a performance without going through it?
- How does the code calling the model know _which_ rule was broken?
- If the data moved from a JSON file to a database tomorrow, which files
  would change?

You will defend these choices at the oral, on your own code.

## Start

Follow the project track, from its step 00:

```bash
uv init --no-package
uv run main.py
```

The track builds the project step by step, from reading this file to the
whole API: each step says what must work at its end, never which functions
or classes to write.

## Levels

| Level | Status   | Criteria                                                                                                         |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1    | required | the program runs from a fresh clone, the rules hold, errors give clear messages, the code reads well             |
| P2    | expected | coherent classes: inheritance and abstract classes where they fit, encapsulation, your own errors, storage apart |
| P3    | bonus    | `ruff format` and `ruff check` clean, type annotations, docstrings, your tests, `uv build` works, the web API    |

Extension: a second storage in a SQLite database (e.g. SQLModel), usable in
place of the JSON file without changing the model.

## Submission

The last push before the deadline is graded. Your README replaces this one
and says:

- what the project does, how to install it, run it and run the tests;
- your structure: the modules and classes, and why (the questions above);
- what is done, and what is not.

A fresh clone must work with `uv sync`, then the commands of your README.
